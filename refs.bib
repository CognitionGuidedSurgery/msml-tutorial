                              has become an important tool in diagnostics, computer-assisted interventions
                              and training. This modeling approach seeks to construct patient-specific
                              biomechanical models from tomographic data. Usually many different tools
                              such as segmentation and meshing algorithms are involved in this workflow.
                              In this paper we present a generalized and flexible description for
                              biomechanical models. The unique feature of the new modeling language is
                              that it not only describes the final biomechanical simulation, but also the
                              workflow how the biomechanical model is constructed from tomographic data.
                              In this way, the MSML can act as a middleware between all tools used in the
                              modeling pipeline. The MSML thus greatly facilitates the prototyping of
                              medical simulation workflows for clinical and research purposes.
                              In this paper, we not only detail the XML-based modeling scheme, but also
                              present a concrete implementation. Different examples highlight the
                              flexibility, robustness and ease-of-use of the approach.},
